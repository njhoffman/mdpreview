# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses Semantic Versioning with
annotated `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` Git tags.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- `-v` as a short form of `--version`, and `-c`/`--cat` for `--paging=never`.
- `--version` prints `mdpreview X.Y.Z` from the `VERSION` file; `--check` lists it with the other versions.
- `tests/version.bats`: `--version`, `VERSION`, the newest CHANGELOG release and a tagged HEAD agree.
- `--check` compiles the Tree-sitter highlights and injections queries of every `filetypes.json` language,
  reports failures as warnings and lists the languages shown with regex syntax; `--check --all` covers every
  installed parser (code fence languages; about 20 s with 300 parsers).
- `tests/dependencies.bats`: query mismatches, a missing or broken Neovim, a missing msgpack, Lua errors.
- `tests/inputs.bats`: every Markdown extension in lower, upper and mixed case, uppercase extensions of other
  filetypes, symbolic links and chains, unreadable inputs, empty files and stdin in each mode, and a Neovim
  killed mid-render.
- `tests/fzf.bats`: names with `|`, `:`, quotes, spaces, `$(...)`, glob characters and a leading `-` pass
  through fzf's `{}` to mdpreview and mdpreview-dispatch, and a tab-separated grep match jumps to its line.
- `docs/RELEASING.md`: one commit and tag per changelog version, and the full test suite before each release.
- README: memory and time limits by input size; mdpreview does not stream and is not meant for large files.

### Changed

- Every render limit now falls back to bat with a one-line notice naming the limit and the flag that changes
  it: input over 10 MiB (Neovim is not started; stdin is passed on in full) and a `--timeout` now join the
  4,096-row limit and `--budget`. A timeout falls back in viewports and fzf previews too, showing the same
  viewport of bat's output instead of an error. `--fallback=none` still turns each into an error.
- Fallback output for the `nvim` pager is paged with `less -R`.
- A Tree-sitter query that does not compile against its parser ("Invalid node type"), whether for the file's
  language, Markdown, or a language in a code fence, no longer aborts the render with a Lua stack trace. That
  language loses Tree-sitter highlighting (a whole file falls back to regex syntax) and one warning on stderr
  names the query file and what to update. The Neovim pager shows the warning as a notification.
- Errors from Neovim are reduced to their innermost message, without stack traces or autocommand chains.

### Fixed

- A `FZF_PREVIEW_COLUMNS` or `FZF_PREVIEW_LINES` that is not a whole number is a usage error naming the variable
  (exit 2) instead of a Python `ValueError` traceback; an empty value counts as unset.
- Complete output never finished for documents over 1,000 screen rows, or ones whose resize asked for more
  (from about 500 source lines up): Neovim clamps its grid to 1,000 rows and mdpreview waited for a taller
  frame until `--budget` or `--timeout` ran out, then blamed the budget. The row limit is now 1,000 (it was
  documented as 4,096, which could never be reached), output over it falls back to bat at once with the
  row-limit notice, and `--lines` accepts at most 1000.
- The README no longer repeats the version number, which had fallen behind.
- A failing bat during a fallback is reported with its exit status instead of a Python traceback, and a
  missing bat is named in the error.
- A timeout while Neovim was starting skipped the fallback.
- `--syntax regex` now applies to filetypes whose Neovim ftplugin starts Tree-sitter itself, such as Lua.
- A missing Python msgpack, and an `--nvim` or `nvim` setting that is not an executable, are reported in one
  line instead of a traceback or `[Errno 2]`.
- A symbolic link whose own name matches no `filetypes.json` entry is matched by its target's name, so an
  extensionless link to a `.ebnf` file no longer renders as Markdown.
- Unreadable inputs name the file and the reason (`no such file`, `broken symbolic link to X`, `too many
  levels of symbolic links`, `permission denied`, `not a regular file`) instead of `[Errno N]` text.
- The README fzf example failed for a filename starting with `-`; it now passes `--` before `{}`. A new grep
  example splits matches on a tab, since a `:` in a filename broke `{1}`/`{2}`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- `--timings` and `--timings-json`: per-phase timings and peak memory on stderr after rendering (Python
  imports, config, Neovim startup with each setup step, edit, filetype, parser load, query compilation, parse,
  render-markdown, redraw, resize rounds, Python's RPC handling, ANSI encoding, close), also on failure.
- `--syntax auto|regex`: force Vim's regex syntax instead of Tree-sitter; regex Markdown skips
  render-markdown. The built-in pager honours it.
- `benchmarks/filetypes` (`make bench-filetypes`): hyperfine timings for every `filetypes.json` entry on its
  fixture and a 500-line version, comparing complete output, `--syntax regex`, a viewport, bat and the
  dispatch overhead, with a phase split per file. Records `benchmarks/filetypes.tsv` and the table in
  `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`; `--check` exits 1 on a regression (25% and 50 ms by default).
- `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`: where the time goes, from the profile, and the per-filetype table.
- `tests/timings.bats` and `tests/benchmarks.bats`; a pager test for `--syntax regex`.

### Changed

- `benchmarks/run` also measures an fzf mode (fzf's preview variables, the time to the first usable preview)
  and records the startup time and the peak RSS of Neovim and of mdpreview's Python in `history.tsv` and the
  SYNTAX.md table. Shared helpers moved to `benchmarks/common.py`.
- `make check-dev` lists hyperfine.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- Built-in Neovim pager, now the default for `--paging`: the document opens in a read-only Neovim on the
  terminal with the same profile and render-markdown options, live rendering, Neovim search and motions,
  re-wrap on resize, no 4,096-row limit, and less-style `q`, `space`/`f`, `b`, `d`, `u`. The cursor line
  never shows raw Markdown, and the first frame is already rendered. In auto mode one screen is rendered
  first to measure the document, so short documents are still printed.
- `--pager nvim|less|COMMAND` and a `pager` config key (`MDPREVIEW_PAGER`) to choose the pager; `less` means
  `less -R`. `--check` lists it.
- `tests/pager.bats` and `tests/helpers/pager_session.py`, which drive the pager in a pseudo-terminal: keys,
  search, resize, SIGTERM/SIGHUP cleanup, stdin documents, the auto-mode probe, and pager selection.

### Changed

- The default pager is the built-in Neovim pager instead of `less -R`. An existing `MDPREVIEW_PAGER` command
  still selects that command; set `pager = "less"` or pass `--pager less` to keep less.
- SIGHUP now cancels a render or pager cleanly, like SIGTERM.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-10-31

### Fixed

- Paged output showed Nerd Font icons (render-markdown's heading icons and other Private Use Area glyphs) as
  `<U+F0CA3>` in less. The pager now gets `LESSUTFCHARDEF` marking those ranges printable and single-width,
  as Neovim laid them out; a `LESSUTFCHARDEF` already in the environment is kept.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- README "Output modes" section: how complete-document and viewport output are chosen, their limits and
  paging, and how scrolling, resizing, `--start-line`, and fzf line offsets behave in each.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- Portable tests ported from the historical harnesses: `robustness.bats`, `languages.bats` and `fzf.bats`,
  with Python helpers in `tests/helpers/` and self-contained reference documents in
  `tests/fixtures/reference/`. Paths resolve from the checkout, output goes to temporary directories, child
  processes are found through `/proc`, and the code-color check reads the theme's String color.

### Removed

- The historical harness scripts and their captures, and their `.gitignore` entries.

### Changed

- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` updated for dispatch, filetype support, and the test suite.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- `Makefile`: `install`/`uninstall` (symlinks into `$(PREFIX)/bin`, refusing to replace real files),
  `check`, `check-dev`, `deps`, `test`, `bench`, `dispatch`.
- `requirements.txt`, and a README dependency table with the versions tested.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-31

Configurable dependencies instead of hardcoded personal paths.

### Added

- Configuration file `~/.config/mdpreview/config.toml` (or `$MDPREVIEW_CONFIG`) with `MDPREVIEW_<KEY>`
  overrides, replacing the hardcoded editor, theme, plugin, and parser paths. See `config.example.toml`.
- `mdpreview --check`: resolved settings and their sources, dependency versions, warnings, and errors.

### Changed

- Only Neovim and render-markdown.nvim are required. A missing theme, render-markdown options file,
  `mini.icons`, or parser directory is skipped (Neovim's default colors, render-markdown's defaults, bundled
  parsers). Existing setups need a config file to keep their theme and options: set `lua_path`, `theme` and
  `markdown_options`.
- `markdown_options` may return the options table instead of calling `setup()`.

### Removed

- `readonly.py`'s command-line entry point (an experiment-only `--verify` mode with hardcoded paths).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-31

### Added

- `benchmarks/run`: waits for a low load average, times small, medium, large and code-fence-heavy Markdown
  samples in complete and viewport mode, appends to `benchmarks/history.tsv`, and updates a comparison table
  against the running averages in `SYNTAX.md`. `benchmarks/generate.py` writes the samples.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-31

Large-table fixes, faster complete output, and a bat fallback.

### Fixed

- Large Markdown tables no longer hang: Neovim's `conceal_lines` highlight hook did per-line work over every
  injected tree, so even a 20-line view of a 600-row table never finished. A 600-row viewport now takes
  about 0.4 s. Complete output of very large tables is still slow (see Known limits).
- Complete output (`mdpreview FILE` in a terminal, `--all`) of short documents could time out at random:
  render-markdown's debounce dropped the update after the resize. mdpreview now disables it.
- Timeouts report any errors Neovim raised while rendering.

### Added

- `--budget SECONDS` (default 5) for complete output, and `--fallback=bat|none`: documents that take longer
  or exceed 4,096 rows are shown with bat (paged as usual) instead of failing. `mdpreview-dispatch` uses
  `--budget=2`.
- `docs/upstream/`: a draft Neovim issue with `nvim --clean` reproduction scripts for the highlighter cost.

### Changed

- Complete output is 2-3x faster on large documents: two forced full redraws per render were removed and the
  grid starts at the document's line count instead of the screen height (300-row table 5.3 s to 1.8 s,
  600-row 19 s to 5.3 s). Output is byte-identical.

Known limits: complete output still grows with rows x table cells inside Neovim's Tree-sitter highlighter;
`SYNTAX.md` (about 1,000 rows) falls back to bat.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-31

Pages long documents with less by default on a terminal.

### Added

- `--paging=auto|always|never`. The default, `auto`, pages the complete document with
  `$MDPREVIEW_PAGER` (default `less -R`) on a terminal when it is taller than the screen, and prints it
  in pipes, viewports, fzf previews, and Neovim terminal buffers (Telescope).

### Changed

- Running `mdpreview FILE` in a terminal now opens long documents in less instead of printing them; use
  `--paging=never` for the old behavior. `mdpreview-dispatch` passes `--paging=never`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-31

Renders non-Markdown filetypes and adds an fzf dispatcher.

### Added

- `SYNTAX.md`: the filetypes mdpreview renders (Markdown and its verified code-fence languages), and the
  filetypes the local Neovim highlights that bat has no syntax for, split into Tree-sitter parsers (189)
  and regex syntax files (667), each with the file extensions and names Neovim maps to it.

- Render non-Markdown files: about 40 filetypes bat cannot highlight (tmux, kitty, hyprlang, i3, sxhkd,
  mutt, just, kdl, json5, helm, Go templates, Django HTML, and more), using Tree-sitter when a highlights
  query is installed and Neovim regex syntax otherwise. The list lives in `filetypes.json`.
- `--filetype FT` to choose the Neovim filetype; without it the `filetypes.json` table is used, then
  Neovim's detection, then Markdown.
- `mdpreview-dispatch`, a generated bash router for fzf previews: matching files go to mdpreview, the rest
  (and any mdpreview failure) to bat. `--print` reports the decision. Regenerate with `./gen-dispatch`.
  systemd unit files go to mdpreview even though bat highlights them as INI.
- Bats test suite (`bats tests/`) for routing and for rendering every listed filetype.

### Fixed

- README install instructions: link `~/.local/bin/mdpreview` to the checkout instead of copying it. A copy
  cannot find `readonly.py`, `profile.lua`, or `queries/` and fails on startup. Corrected the checkout path.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-22

Initial standalone Markdown renderer.

### Added

- Capture Neovim's rendered character grid and emit RGB ANSI terminal output.
- Load selected editor colors, render-markdown options, icons, and installed Tree-sitter parser/query pairs.
- Support complete output, a viewport, explicit width, starting line, and finite stdin.
- Preserve Markdown decorations, nested bullets, tables, code backgrounds, and language labels.
- Highlight C/C++, Rust, Bash, Go, Python, JavaScript, SQL, and common fence aliases.
- Restrict writes with Linux Landlock and clean up Neovim on normal completion or cancellation.
- Document terminal and fzf usage, architecture, compatibility limits, and follow-up work.

Known limits: personal installation paths, Linux/x86-64, no persistent worker, a 10 MiB input limit, and a
4,096-row complete-output limit. Released-Neovim compatibility and portable CI remain unverified.
