# Development and Integration

## Runtime files

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `mdpreview` | CLI options, dependency paths, MessagePack RPC, screen decoding, ANSI output, process cleanup |
| `profile.lua` | Isolated Neovim options, theme and Markdown setup, render-ready signaling |
| `readonly.py` | Linux Landlock write restriction |
| `queries/markdown/injections.scm` | C++ fence-label injection |

The renderer starts Neovim with its own init file and reads selected appearance modules from the editor config.
Do not replace that profile with the full interactive editor startup: it would load unrelated plugins and state.
The older nvimpager configuration remains a separate working setup.

## Parser and query compatibility

Use the matching installed parser and query files under `~/.local/share/nvim/site`. The first prototype found
old parser binaries in a plugin checkout while omitting the highlight queries. Combining old SQL binaries with
newer SQL queries also produced invalid-node errors. The installed editor data directory supplies coherent pairs.
Normal aliases use Neovim's language registration; the extra query handles `c++`, whose punctuation prevents
normal injection-name lookup.

## Local checks

```sh
python3 - <<'PY'
import ast
from pathlib import Path
for name in ("mdpreview", "readonly.py"):
    ast.parse(Path(name).read_text(), filename=name)
PY
luac -p profile.lua
./mdpreview --columns 80 README.md > /tmp/mdpreview-readme.ansi
./mdpreview --columns 120 --lines 40 README.md > /tmp/mdpreview-viewport.ansi
```

The bats suite (`make test`) covers what the initial experiments checked, with self-contained fixtures in
`tests/fixtures/reference/` and temporary output directories: complete-document tails and viewport heights,
Unicode through Neovim's terminal emulator (`tests/helpers/roundtrip.py`), finite stdin, literal filenames,
modelines, errors, SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGKILL cleanup, source immutability, the Landlock sandbox, per-language
code-token colors (`tests/helpers/languages.py`, which reads the theme's String color instead of hardcoding it),
and a real fzf session (`tests/helpers/fzf_session.py`). The original harnesses and captures were removed.

## Profiling

Profile before optimizing: `./mdpreview --timings FILE` splits one render into startup, theme, plugin setup,
parser loading, query compilation, parsing, render-markdown, redraw, Python's RPC handling, and ANSI encoding
(see the README). Neovim records its phases with `vim.uv.hrtime()` in `profile.lua` (`lap()`), Python with
`time.monotonic_ns()`; both are CLOCK_MONOTONIC, which is how Neovim's startup marks are placed on Python's
timeline. Add a phase by wrapping it in `lap(name, start)` (Neovim) or `timings.phase(name)` (Python); a
name with `": "` is a sub-phase of the part before it. `benchmarks/filetypes` and `benchmarks/run` read
`--timings-json`; findings are in [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md).

## Mixed-file fzf routing

Use the generated `mdpreview-dispatch` (see the README): it routes Markdown and the filetypes in
`filetypes.json` to mdpreview and everything else, plus any mdpreview failure, to bat. Configure fzf's
`resize:refresh-preview` binding to rerender at a new width; the preview command cannot configure the parent
fzf process.

## Other filetypes

`filetypes.json` lists the non-Markdown filetypes; `profile.lua` highlights them with Tree-sitter when a
highlights query is installed and with Neovim's regex syntax otherwise, and signals readiness itself instead of
waiting for render-markdown. Parsers load on demand.

## Follow-up work

See [TODO.md](../TODO.md). Keep the input immutability, cancellation, and ANSI-output checks for any
optimization, and run `benchmarks/run` after every change; run `benchmarks/filetypes --check` after changes
to the profile, the filetype table, or parser handling.
